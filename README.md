# JobMatch Application (Okcupid & Linkedin = Okcinkedin)

The JobMatch application is a project developed for the university data structure and algorithms course. The main goal of this project is to facilitate accurate matching between employers and job seekers by visualizing their skills and preferences.

## Purpose

The purpose of the JobMatch application is to help employers find suitable candidates for job positions and enable job seekers to connect with potential employers based on their programming skills and preferences. The application achieves this by allowing users to specify the programming languages they are proficient in and their university information.

## Features

- Employers can register and log in to the application.
- Job seekers can register and log in to the application.
- Users can specify their programming skills and preferences.
- The application matches employers and job seekers based on their skill sets.
- Visual representation of the matching process helps users to identify potential matches easily.

## Usage

1. Register as an employer or a job seeker.
2. Log in using your credentials.
3. Specify your programming languages and university information.
4. Get matched with suitable candidates or potential job positions.
5. Visualize the matching process to understand the matches.

## Development
  
The Okcinkedin application was developed as a university project to demonstrate the application of data structures and algorithms in a real-world scenario. It utilizes a combination of C# and Windows Forms for the user interface and SQL Server for data storage.

## Future Enhancements
